# Quantum Battlefield

Little project made in a python notebook where two teams of soldiers driven by quantum and classical algorithms compete to win, as an entry to the hackathon https://meetiqm.com/quantum-hack/

# Setup

The python notebook has a setup section provided by the hackathon that sets the environment up. You need to have an API key to https://resonance.meetiqm.com/

# Description

In this project we provide an implementation of a random walk classic algorithm for the red soldiers, and a quantum version of the same algorithm for a quantum computer.
In that we can see how quantum is superior in ease of use and efficiency in some specific aspects, like true number generation, due to its nature.

In previous versions of the project we tried to make a QAOA based on heuristics and that we tweaked through a genetic algorithm, but we didn't have enough time to finish training it.
We also tried implementing a proper QAOA with the qrisp helpers, but due to a lack of understanding and time we weren't able to fix its errors.
